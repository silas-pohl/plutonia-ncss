\section{Risk Management}
To identify Plutonia's cybersecurity risks, a SWOT analysis should be conducted. This will highlight the country's cybersecurity strengths and weaknesses, providing a clear picture of areas for quick improvement and those needing more focused effort. Plutonia's advanced technology with widespread 4G, 5G in the capital, and ADSL in rural areas, along with five internet providers, reduces the risk of total internet shutdown if one provider fails. However, the absence of a domestic Internet Exchange Point, relying instead on external points in the Mediterranean and an eastern neighbor, poses a significant risk. Damage to these points could disrupt the internet, severely impacting critical sectors like healthcare, education, and communication in Plutonia. With the geographical location of Plutonia and its proximity to Nato bases and a superpower nation, it is stuck in the middle and needs to be vigilant for tensions in the area that could potentially lead to cyber espionage or cyber attacks. While an investment in an internet exchange point would be costly at first, it's a long term investment that can improve self reliance of the country's internet, reduce latency, improve control of the routing of data and limit risks of disturbances to it. With the geographical location of Plutionia and it not being a strong military force, collaboration with EU, Enisa and Nato is very important in order to mitigate risk of conflict and cyber warfare. By engaging in partnership with these organizations Plutonia can get informed of potential cyber threats and how to strengthen its security posture. 

\section{Monitoring and Evaluation}
The ultimate goal of the NCSS is to aid Plutonia and avert national crises. Should cyber threats occur, the strategy needs to be well established and ready to handle any problems. But in order to improve the NCSS it needs to be constantly improved to provide the best possible protection for Plutonia's inhabitants. The NCSS should be regularly reviewed with an interval of three years for full assessments. Additional audits should be conducted upon major incidents in the world. Participants for such reviews should include the main stakeholders from the public areas government and academia as well as private areas. Public-private partnerships will help realize the review process in an efficient manner. There are two specific current projects that should be closely observed. First, the test phase of the digital hospital journal system. After the test phase, the systemâs cybersecurity aspects should be evaluated.\footnote{Assumption that no documents detailing this plan exist. } Second, the development of 5G. Protective security measures should be audited according to state regulations.\footnote{Assumption that such a document exists in legislation.} To uphold the effectiveness of the NCSS, structures of accountability need to be in place. To prevent conflicts of interest during evaluation and monitoring, the public and private sector need to cooperate. Furthermore, cooperation with Europol and Interpol should facilitate information sharing to profit from a shared pool of knowledge. Additional contact with the civil contingency agency will provide insights in current ongoing events.


\section{Legal and Compliance}
In alignment with the preventive function of the NCSS, certain areas of law and other legal regulations need to be further examined. To support the NCSS, reforms for strengthening the protection of critical infrastructure are to be done. New legislation should be introduced to improve cybercrime investigation and prosecution capabilities. Additionally, an appropriate legal framework for data protection and privacy should be established. A Cybersecurity Compliance Act\footnote{Assumption that such an act doesnât already exist.} will enforce mandatory compliance in the public sector as well as providers of critical infrastructure to improve resilience. The voluntary compliance of the private sector is promoted with incentives for strong cybersecurity practices.

\section{Conclusion}
The NCSS for Plutiona effectively addresses the nation's specific challenges through a focused approach on objectives, initiatives and responsibilities of key sectors and services to enhance cyber resilience and thus get a step closer to the vision that was agreed upon. The strategy emphasizes the critical role of cyber defense capabilities, public-private partnerships, security awareness among the citizenry and innovation in the area of cyber security.

A multi-pronged approach will be implemented to secure various aspects of Plutoniaâs framework, such as consideration of citizens' well-being, critical infrastructure, and national defense. This involves improving the education system and increasing awareness, fostering beneficial international relationships, and the creation of a central cybersecurity agency. A risk management analysis shows Plutonia's reliance on external internet exchange points and proximity to geopolitical tensions heightens cybersecurity risks. This requires strategic investments and international collaboration to improve security. International collaboration is key, leveraging global insights and support to enhance Plutoniaâs cyber defense capabilities. These points reflect Plutonia's strategic direction in cybersecurity, focusing on resilience, collaboration, and continuous improvement to protect its digital ecosystem. With the help of dedicated review mechanisms the NCSS can be continuously monitored and improved. Appropriate legal frameworks will help enforce the compliance of organizations.
